## Global Colding
A foray into making games in Godot. None of us have ever touched Godot before and spent about 6 hours to make about 6 seconds of gameplay.
Control the champion of ice that freezes things to prevent them from producing carbon emissions!
If the temperature rises to a high enough level, a threshold is passed and the heat death of the universe becomes inevitable
The lore is deep, the gameplay is unfortunately not
However, we sure did learn a lot
